HAL = Hardware Abstraction Layer

This module provides a basic interface between the main code written in other modules and the actual hardware itself.
For example, this module will include various classes for things like the motor and the sensors, and all the code to easily interface with these
components will be here so when trying to, for example, move the motor in another bit of code it can just call something like moveMotor(0.1) and it
will move the motor 0.1m, all of the heavy code is handled here like communicating over IIC, setting pin outputs, etc. 

This also means that if we change a specific sensor at any point during the project, we will only need to edit the code here as that's all that interfaces 
directly with the hardware.
