## Overview

This project was completed for Swansea University's Embedded Systems Design module, EG-252. The task involved creating a micromouse robot capable of completing three tasks: 
- **Line Following:** Follow a black line painted onto a white surface around turns and patterns designed to test the mouse's ability.
- **Obstacle Avoidance:** Navigate around a course with various obstacles that the mouse may crash into.
- **Combat Event:** Stay inside a box designated with a black line on the floor, whilst simultaneously trying to push the opponent out of the box.

All code is written by the following team members and overseen by the project head of programming.
