# Navigation Module

This module includes any code related to navigation of the micromouse.
This includes high-level routines that handle movement logic and path planning. These routines could include:
- Finding the position of the mouse
- Logic for different mouse modes (e.g. line following movement, obstacle avoidance movement, and sumo movement)

Basically, this module decides where the robot should go next, then passes that information to the control modules to acc move the robot there
